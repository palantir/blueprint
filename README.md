# [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/palantir/blueprint/tree/develop.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/palantir/workflows/blueprint)

Blueprint is a React-based UI toolkit for the web.

It is optimized for building complex, data-dense web interfaces for _desktop applications_ which run in modern browsers and IE11. This is not a mobile-first UI toolkit.

## Latest changelog

[**3.x Changelog and 3.0 migration guide ▸**](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/wiki/3.x-Changelog)

Blueprint 3.0 brings support for using multiple major versions of Blueprint on the same web page. This is possible through the removal of global styles and by deconflicting CSS selectors. It also restores support for React 15 as a peer dependency in most packages.

### Upgrading from 1.x

Check out the [**2.0 changelog**](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/wiki/What's-new-in-Blueprint-2.0) on the wiki, and make sure to review the [**2.0 migration guide**](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/wiki/What's-new-in-Blueprint-2.0#migration-path), in addition to the 3.x content above.

## Packages

This repository contains multiple projects in the `packages/` directory that fall into 3 categories:

### Libraries

These are the component libraries we publish to NPM.

- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blueprintjs/core.svg?label=@blueprintjs/core)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/core) &ndash; Core styles & components.
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blueprintjs/datetime.svg?label=@blueprintjs/datetime)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/datetime) &ndash; Components for interacting with dates and times.
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blueprintjs/icons.svg?label=@blueprintjs/icons)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/icons) &ndash; Components for generating and displaying icons.
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blueprintjs/select.svg?label=@blueprintjs/select)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/select) &ndash; Components for selecting items from a list.
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blueprintjs/table.svg?label=@blueprintjs/table)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/table) &ndash; Scalable interactive table component.
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blueprintjs/timezone.svg?label=@blueprintjs/timezone)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/timezone) &ndash; Components for picking timezones.

### Applications

These are hosted on GitHub Pages as static web applications:

- `docs-app` &ndash; Documentation site at blueprintjs.com/docs
- `landing-app` &ndash; Landing page at blueprintjs.com

These are used as development playground environments:

- `table-dev-app` &ndash; demo page that supports manual testing of all table features

### Build tooling

These packages define development dependencies and contain build configuration. They adhere to the standard NPM package layout, which allows us to keep clear API boundaries for build configuration and isolate groups of `devDependencies`. They are published to NPM in order to allow other Blueprint-related projects to use this infrastructure outside this monorepo.

- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blueprintjs/docs-theme.svg?label=@blueprintjs/docs-theme)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/docs-theme) &ndash; Documentation theme for [Documentalist](https://github.com/palantir/documentalist) data.
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blueprintjs/karma-build-scripts.svg?label=@blueprintjs/karma-build-scripts)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/karma-build-scripts)
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blueprintjs/node-build-scripts.svg?label=@blueprintjs/node-build-scripts)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/node-build-scripts)
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blueprintjs/test-commons.svg?label=@blueprintjs/test-commons)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/test-commons)
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blueprintjs/tslint-config.svg?label=@blueprintjs/tslint-config)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/tslint-config)
- [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@blueprintjs/webpack-build-scripts.svg?label=@blueprintjs/webpack-build-scripts)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/webpack-build-scripts)

## Development

[Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) manages inter-package dependencies in this monorepo.
Builds are orchestrated via `lerna run` and NPM scripts.

__Prerequisites__: Node.js v8+, Yarn v1.10+

### One-time setup

After cloning this repo, run:

1. `yarn` to install all dependencies.
1. `yarn verify` to ensure you have all the build tooling working properly.

### Incorporating upstream changes

If you were previously in a working state and have just pulled new code from `develop`:

- If there were package dependency changes, run `yarn` at the root.
  - This command is very quick if there are no new things to install.
- Run `yarn compile` to get the latest built versions of the library packages in this repo.
  - This command is quicker than `yarn verify` since it doesn't build the application packages (`docs-app`, `landing-app`, etc.) or run tests

### Developing libraries

Run `yarn dev` from the root directory to watch changes across all packages and run the docs application with webpack-dev-server.

Alternately, each library has its own dev script to run the docs app and watch changes to just that package (and its dependencies): `yarn dev:core`, `yarn dev:datetime`, etc.
One exception is `table`: since it has its own dev application, the `dev:table` script runs `table-dev-app` instead of the docs.

### Updating documentation

Much of Blueprint's documentation lives inside source code as JSDoc comments in `.tsx` files and KSS markup in `.scss` files. This documentation is extracted and converted into static JSON data using [documentalist](https://github.com/palantir/documentalist/).

If you are updating documentation sources (_not_ the docs UI code which lives in `packages/docs-app` or the docs theme in `packages/docs-theme`), you'll need to run `yarn compile` from `packages/docs-data` to see changes reflected in the application. For simplicity, an alias script `yarn docs-data` exists in the root to minimize directory hopping.

### Updating icons

The [One-time setup](#one-time-setup) and [Incorporating upstream changes](#incorporating-upstream-changes) steps should produce the generated
source code in this repo used to build the icons documentation. This is sufficient for most development workflows.

If you are updating icons or adding new ones, you'll need to run `yarn compile` in `packages/icons` to see those changes reflected before
running any of the dev scripts.
