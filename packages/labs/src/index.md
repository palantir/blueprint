    The **[@blueprintjs/labs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/labs)** NPM package contains **unstable React components under active development by team members**. It is an incubator and staging area for components as we refine the API design; as such, this package will never reach 1.0.0, and every minor version should be considered breaking.
