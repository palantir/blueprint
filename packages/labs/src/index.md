@# Labs

<div class="@ns-callout @ns-intent-warning @ns-icon-info-sign">
    <h4 class="@ns-heading">Under construction</h4>

The **[@blueprintjs/labs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/labs)** NPM package contains **unstable React components under active development by team members**.
It is an incubator and staging area for components as we refine the API design; as such, this package will never reach 1.0.0, and every minor version should be considered breaking.
</div>

There are currently no components in labs.

`@blueprintjs/labs@0.15.x` re-exports components from `@blueprintjs/core`, `@blueprintjs/select`, and `@blueprintjs/timezone` which were previously available in this package. __These exports are provided as migration convenience only and will be removed in the next minor version__.
