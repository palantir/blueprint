# [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/) Laboratory for Component Development

Blueprint is a React UI toolkit for the web.

This package contains in-progress and unstable React components as we develop them.

Current components:

- `QueryList` is a low-level component for filtering an array of `items` with keyboard selection interactions.
- `Select` is a high-level component for choosing items from a list. It can be used instead of the
  HTML `<select>` element.

## Installation

```
npm install --save @blueprintjs/labs
```
