@# Timezone

The **@blueprintjs/timezone** NPM package provides React components related to handling and selecting Timezones.

- [`TimezonePicker`](#timezone/timezone-picker), which allows the user to select from a list of timezones.

Be aware that this package depends on [moment](https://momentjs.com/) and [moment-timezone](https://momentjs.com/timezone/) which may
be a significant factor in a consumer's bundle size.

Make sure to review the [general usage docs for JS components](#blueprint.usage).

```sh
npm install --save @blueprintjs/timezone
```
