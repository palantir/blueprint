# [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/) Date & Time Components (V2)

Blueprint is a React UI toolkit for the web.

This package contains re-exports of components from @blueprintjs/datetime2. These "V2" components were
previously available in @blueprintjs/datetime2 v4.x, but they were promoted to the standard "V1" components in
@blueprintjs/datetime v5.x.

Once you upgrade to Blueprint v5.0, you should migrate your imports to the @blueprintjs/datetime package.

```diff
- import { DateInput2 } from "@blueprintjs/datetime2";
+ import { DateInput } from "@blueprintjs/datetime";
```
