  // Despite being added to added as a supported SVG attribute to React in 2023, the `transformOrigin` JSX attribute
  // is still difficult to use in our statically-generated icon components (`<AddClip>`, `<Calendar>`, etc.)
  // which rely on a centered scale `transform="..."` to display their `<path>` elements correctly. To work around
  // this, we apply the necessary style in CSS instead. Note that this needs to apply directly to the `<path>` element
  // and not the container `<svg>`. See:
