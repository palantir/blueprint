@# Icons

Blueprint provides over 300 vector UI icons in two sizes (16px and 20px) and two formats (SVG and fonts).
It's easy to change their color or apply effects like text shadows via standard SVG or CSS properties.

Many Blueprint components support an `icon` prop which accepts an icon name (such as `"history"`) or a JSX element to use as the icon.

<div class="@ns-callout @ns-intent-primary @ns-icon-info-sign">
    See the [**`Icon` component documentation**](#core/components/icon) for full API details.
</div>
