@## Quick start

### Install

**@blueprintjs/core** is the primary Blueprint package on NPM and home to over 40 components. Install it with your package manager ([Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is used in this example):

```sh
yarn add @blueprintjs/core react react-dom
```

Additional components live in the **@blueprintjs/icons**, **@blueprintjs/datetime**, **@blueprintjs/select**, **@blueprintjs/table**, and **@blueprintjs/timezone** packages, separated by use case and significant dependencies. All have peer dependencies on **react** and **react-dom**, so these two packages must be installed alongside Blueprint.

### Import

Import React components from the appropriate package.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@blueprintjs/core";

<Button intent="success" text="button content" onClick={incrementCounter} />
```

For this button to be styled correctly in the DOM, it needs its associated CSS to be loaded on the page.
Don't forget to include the **main CSS file** from each Blueprint package and their dependencies!
The following example shows an `index.html` file; the same stylesheets should be loaded if you use a bundler like Webpack.

```html
<link href="path/to/node_modules/normalize.css/normalize.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<!-- blueprint-icons.css file must be included alongside blueprint.css! -->
<link href="path/to/node_modules/@blueprintjs/icons/lib/css/blueprint-icons.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="path/to/node_modules/@blueprintjs/core/lib/css/blueprint.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<!-- add other blueprint-*.css files here -->
```
