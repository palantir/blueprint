@## Quick start

### Install

[**@blueprintjs/core**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/core) is the primary Blueprint library package,
home to over 40 UI components.
Install it with your Node.js package manager of choice ([Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is used in this example):

```sh
yarn add @blueprintjs/core react react-dom
```

Additional UI components and APIs are available in:
- [**@blueprintjs/icons**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/icons)
- [**@blueprintjs/datetime**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/datetime)
- [**@blueprintjs/datetime2**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/datetime2)
- [**@blueprintjs/select**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/select)
- [**@blueprintjs/table**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/table)

The navigation sidebar lists all the available packages, separated by use case and significant dependencies.
All have peer dependencies on **react** and **react-dom**.

### Import

Import React components from the appropriate package.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@blueprintjs/core";

<Button intent="success" text="button content" onClick={incrementCounter} />
```

For this button to be styled correctly in the DOM, it needs its associated CSS to be loaded on the page.
Don't forget to include the **main CSS file from each Blueprint package** and their dependencies!
The following example shows an `index.html` file; the same stylesheets should be loaded if you use a bundler like Webpack.

```html
<link href="path/to/node_modules/normalize.css/normalize.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<!-- blueprint-icons.css file must be included alongside blueprint.css! -->
<link href="path/to/node_modules/@blueprintjs/icons/lib/css/blueprint-icons.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="path/to/node_modules/@blueprintjs/core/lib/css/blueprint.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<!-- add other blueprint-*.css files here -->
```
