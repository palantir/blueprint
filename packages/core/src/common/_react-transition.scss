/*
A mixin to generate the classes for a React CSSTransitionGroup which animates any number of CSS
properties at once.

Transitioned properties are specificed as a map of property names to lists of (inital value, final
value). For enter & appear transitions, each property will transition from its initial to its final
value. For leave transitions, each property will transition in reverse, from final to initial.

**Simple example:**
`@include react-transition("pt-popover", (opacity: 0 1), $before: "&");`
Transition named "pt-popover" moves opacity from 0 to 1. `"&"` indicates that the
Transition classes are expected to be applied to this element, where the mixin is invoked.

**Params:**
$name: React transitionName prop
$properties: map of CSS property to (initial, final) values
$duration: transition duration
$easing: transition easing function
$delay: transition delay
$before: selector text to insert before transition name (often to select self: &)
$after: selector text to insert after transiton name (to select children)

A mixin to generate the classes for one phase of a React CSSTransitionGroup.
`$phase` must be `appear` or `enter` or `leave`.
If `enter` phase is given then `appear` phase will be generated at the same time.
If `leave` phase is given then property values are animated in reverse, from final to initial.

**Example:**
@include react-transition-phase(pt-toast, enter, $enter-translate, $before: "&");
@include react-transition-phase(pt-toast, leave, $leave-blur, $pt-transition-duration * 3, $before: "&");
