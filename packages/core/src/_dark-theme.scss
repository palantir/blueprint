Dark theme

Blueprint provides two UI color themes: light and dark. The light theme is active by default.
The dark theme can be applied by adding the class `pt-dark` to a container element to theme
all nested elements.

Once applied, the dark theme will cascade to nested `.pt-*` elements inside a `.pt-dark`
container. There is no way to nest light-themed elements inside a dark container.

Most elements only support the dark theme when nested inside a `.pt-dark` container because it does
not make sense to mark individual elements as dark. The dark container is therefore responsible for setting
a dark background color.

The following elements and components support the `.pt-dark` class directly (i.e,
`.pt-app.pt-dark`) and can be used as a container for nested dark children:

- `.pt-app`
- `.pt-card`
- Overlays: `Dialog`, `Popover`, `Tooltip`, `Toast`
  - `Popover` and `Tooltip` will automatically detect when their trigger is inside a `.pt-dark`
    container and add the same class to themselves.

Rather than illustrating dark components inline, this documentation site provides a site-wide
switch at the bottom of the sidebar to enable the dark theme. Try it out as you read the docs.
