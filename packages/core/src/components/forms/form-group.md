@# Form groups

Form groups support more complex form controls than [simple labels](#components.forms.labels.simple-labels),
such as [control groups](#components.forms.control-group) or [`NumericInput`](#components.forms.numeric-input).
They also support additional helper text to aid with user navigation.

- Link each label to its respective control element with a `for={#id}` attribute on the `<label>` and
`id={#id}` on the control.

- Add `.pt-intent-*` or `.pt-disabled` to `.pt-form-group` to style the label and helper text.
Similar to labels, nested controls need to be styled separately.

- Add `.pt-inline` to `.pt-form-group` to place the label to the left of the control.

- Add `.pt-large` to `.pt-form-group` to align the label when used with large inline Blueprint controls.
