@# Switch

__Switch__ is a form control for toggling between boolean states. It is similar to
[__Checkbox__](#core/components/checkbox), but presents a more skeuomorphic appearance that mimics a physical switch.

Its whole label is interactive and it supports a few visual modifiers for different UI layouts.

Deprecated API: use [`<Switch>`](#core/components/switch)

</h5>

CSS APIs for Blueprint components are considered deprecated, as they are verbose, error-prone, and they
often fall out of sync as the design system is updated. You should use the React component APIs instead.
