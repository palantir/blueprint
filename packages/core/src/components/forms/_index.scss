/*
Form controls

The following controls often appear inside HTML forms. Blueprint does not strictly require the
use of any `<form>` elements, so you can use these controls anywhere in the UI.

Many of the components in this section provide React components for simpler idiomatic usage. These React components try
to transparently mirror the underlying HTML element, so they support the full range of appropriate HTML props. If you
provide a `className` prop, the class names you provide will be added to the default Blueprint class name. If you
specify other attributes that the component provides, you'll overide the default value.
