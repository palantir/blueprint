@# Text areas

Text areas are similar to text inputs, but they are resizable and support multiline editing.

You should also specify `dir="auto"` on text areas
[to better support RTL languages](http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-dir#dirauto)
(in all browsers except Internet Explorer).
