@# Form controls

The following controls often appear inside HTML forms. Blueprint does not strictly require the use
of any `<form>` elements, so you can use these controls anywhere in the UI.

Many of the components in this section provide React components for simpler idiomatic usage. These
React components try to transparently mirror the underlying HTML element, so they support the full
range of appropriate HTML props. If you provide a `className` prop, the class names you provide will
be added to the default Blueprint class name. If you specify other attributes that the component
provides, you'll overide the default value.
