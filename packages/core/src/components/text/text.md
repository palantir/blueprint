@# Text

The `Text` component adds accessible overflow behavior to a line of text by
conditionally adding the title attribute and truncating with an ellipsis when content overflows its container.

@## JavaScript API

The `Text` component is available in the __@blueprintjs/core__ package.
Make sure to review the [general usage docs for JS components](#blueprint.usage).

`Text` accepts and renders arbitrary children. It is intended that these children render as text.
