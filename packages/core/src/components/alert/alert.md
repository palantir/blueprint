@# Alerts

Alerts notify users of important information and force them to acknowledge the alert content before
continuing.

Although similar to [dialogs](#core/components/dialog), alerts are more restrictive and should only be
used for important information. The user can only exit the alert by clicking one of the
confirmation buttonsâ€”clicking the overlay or pressing the `esc` key will not close the alert.

You can only use this component in controlled mode. Use the `onClick` handlers in the primary and
secondary action props to handle closing the `Alert`. Optionally, display an icon next to the body
to show the type of the alert.
