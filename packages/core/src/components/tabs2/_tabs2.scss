JavaScript API

<div class="pt-callout pt-intent-danger pt-icon-error">
  <h5>Original `Tabs` API is deprecated since v1.11.0</h5>
  The original `Tabs` API has been deprecated in v1.11.0 favor of the simpler and more flexible
  `Tabs2` API described below. Documentation for the deprecated components can be found
  [further below](#components.tabs.deprecated). The deprecated components will be removed in v2.0.
</div>

<div class="pt-callout pt-intent-primary pt-icon-info-sign">
  <h5>Advantages of new API</h5>
  <p>Only two components (`Tabs` and `Tab`) are needed, rather than the previous four.</p>
  <p>Selection is managed by ID, rather than by index. This is more reliable and deterministic and
  does not require translating between numbers and tab names. It does, however, require that
  every `Tab` have a locally unique `id` prop.</p>
  <p>Arbitrary elements are supported in the tab list, and order is respected. Yes, you can even
  insert things _between_ `Tab`s.</p>
</div>

The `Tabs2` and `Tab2` components are available in the __@blueprintjs/core__
package. Make sure to review the [general usage docs for JS components](#components.usage).

```
import { Tab2, Tabs2 } from "@blueprintjs/core";

<Tabs2 id="types">
    <Tab2 id="fruits" title="Fruits">
        <h1>A list of fruits</h1>
    </Tab2>
    <Tab2 id="grains" title="Grains">
        <h1>A list of grains</h1>
    </Tab2>
    <Tabs2.Expander />
    <input type="text" placeholder="Search..." />
</Tabs2>
```

/*
Tabs2

`Tabs2` is responsible for rendering the tab list and coordinating selection. It can be used in
controlled mode by providing `selectedTabId` and `onChange` props, or in uncontrolled mode by
optionally providing `defaultSelectedTabId` and `onChange`.

Children of the `Tabs2` are rendered in order in the tab list, which is a horizontal flex row.
`Tab2` children are managed by the component; clicking one will change selection. Arbitrary other
children are your responsibility. Insert a `<Tabs2.Expander />` between any two children to
right-align all subsequent children (or bottom-align when `vertical`).

/*
Tab2

`Tab2` is a minimal wrapper with no functionality of its own&mdash;it is managed entirely by its
parent `Tabs2` wrapper. Tab title text can be set either via `title` prop or via React children
(for more complex content).
