 *
 * OPEN
 * When in this state, the collapse height is set to auto, and the body Y is set to 0 (so the element can be seen
 * as normal).
 *
 * CLOSING_START
 * When in this state, height has been changed from auto to the measured height of the body to prepare for the
 * closing animation in CLOSING_END.
 *
 * CLOSING_END
 * When in this state, the height is set to 0 and the body Y is at -height. Both of these properties are transformed,
 * and then after the animation is complete, the state changes to CLOSED.
 *
 * OPENING
 * When in this state, the body is re-rendered, height is set to the measured body height and the body Y is set to 0.
 * This is all animated, and on complete, the state changes to OPEN.
 *
 * When changing the isOpen prop, the following happens to the states:
 * isOpen = true : CLOSED -> OPENING -> OPEN
 * isOpen = false: OPEN -> CLOSING_START -> CLOSING_END -> CLOSED
 * These are all animated.
