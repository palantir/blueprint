Portals

The `Portal` component renders its children into a new "subtree" outside of the current component hierarchy.
It is essential piece of [`Overlay`](#components.overlay), responsible for ensuring that the overlay contents
cover the application below. In most cases you do not need to use a `Portal` directly; this documentation
is provided simply for reference.

/*
JavaScript API

The `Portal` component is available in the __@blueprintjs/core__ package.
Make sure to review the [general usage docs for JS components](#components.usage).

The `Portal` component functions like a declarative `appendChild()`, or jQuery's `$.fn.appendTo()`.
The children of a `Portal` component are appended to the `<body>` element.

`Portal` is used inside [`Overlay`](#components.overlay) to actually overlay the content on the application.

<div class="pt-callout pt-intent-warning pt-icon-warning-sign">
  <h5>A note about responsive layouts</h5>
  For a single-page app, if the `<body>` is styled with `width: 100%` and `height: 100%`, a `Portal` may take up extra
  whitespace and cause the window to undesirably scroll. To fix this, instead apply `position: absolute` to
  the `<body>` tag.
</div>
