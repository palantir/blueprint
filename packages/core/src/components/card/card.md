@# Cards

A card is a bounded unit of UI content with a solid background color.

@## CSS API

Start with `.pt-card` and add an elevation modifier class to apply a drop shadow that simulates
height in the UI.

You can also use the `.pt-elevation-*` classes by themselves to apply shadows to any arbitrary
element.

@css pt-card

@### Interactive cards

Add the `.pt-interactive` modifier class to make a `.pt-card` respond to user interactions. When you
hover over cards with this class applied, the mouse changes to a pointer and the elevation shadow on
the card increases by two levels.

Users expect an interactive card to be a single clickable unit.

@css pt-card.pt-interactive
