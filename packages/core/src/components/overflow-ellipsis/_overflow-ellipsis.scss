Overflow ellipsis

A component used to wrap textual content that is suspected to overflow the space it is given.
The title attribute is added to the content, ensuring that the full text is available on hover.
In the event of overflow, the text will be truncated and ellipsis added at the end. Internally,
this is done by using the `pt-text-overflow-ellipsis` class.
