@# Panel stack

`PanelStack` manages a stack of panels and displays only the topmost panel.

Each panel appears with a header containing a "back" button to return to the
previous panel. The bottom-most `initialPanel` cannot be closed or removed from
the stack. Panels use
[`CSSTransition`](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)
for seamless transitions.

By default, only the currently active panel is rendered to the DOM. This means
that other panels are unmounted and can lose their component state as a user
transitions between the panels. You can notice this in the example below as
the numeric counter is reset. To render all panels to the DOM and keep their
React trees mounted, change the `renderActivePanelOnly` prop.

@## Panels

Panels are supplied as `Panel` objects, where `renderPanel` and `props` are
used to render the panel element and `title` will appear in the header and back
button. This breakdown allows the component to avoid cloning elements. Note
that each panel is only mounted when it is atop the stack and is unmounted when
it is closed or when a panel opens above it.

`PanelStack` injects panel action callbacks into each panel renderer. These
allow you to close the current panel or open a new one on top of it during the
panel's lifecycle. For example:

```tsx
import { Button, PanelProps } from "@blueprintjs/core";

type SettingsPanelInfo = { /* ...  */ };
type AccountSettingsPanelInfo = { /* ...  */ };
type NotificationSettingsPanelInfo = { /* ...  */ };

const AccountSettingsPanel: React.FC<PanelProps & AccountSettingsPanelInfo> = props => {
    // implementation
};

const NotificationSettingsPanel: React.FC<PanelProps & NotificationSettingsPanelInfo> = props => {
    // implementation
};

const SettingsPanel: React.FC<PanelProps & SettingsPanelInfo> = props => {
    const { openPanel, closePanel, ...info } = props;

    const openAccountSettings = () =>
        openPanel({
            renderPanel: panelProps => <AccountSettingsPanel {...panelProps} {...} />,
            title: "Account settings",
        });
    const openNotificationSettings = () =>
        openPanel({
            renderPanel: panelProps => <NotificationSettingsPanel {...panelProps} {...} />,
            title: "Notification settings",
        });

    return (
        <>
            <Button onClick={openAccountSettings} text="Account settings" />
            <Button onClick={openNotificationSettings} text="Notification settings" />
        </>
    );
}
```

@## Props

PanelStack can be operated as a controlled or uncontrolled component.

If controlled, panels should be added to and removed from the _end_ of the `stack` array.
