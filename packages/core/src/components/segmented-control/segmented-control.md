@# Segmented control

A **SegmentedControl** is a linear collection of buttons which allows users to choose an option from multiple choices,
similar to a [**Radio**](#core/components/radio) group. Its appearance is distinct from and more specific than the
closely-related [**ButtonGroup**](#core/components/button-group) component; **SegmentedControl** provides visual
affordances to signify a selection UI.
