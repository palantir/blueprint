@# Icons

Blueprint provides over 300 UI icons in an icon font. They come in two sizes, 16px and 20px, and can
be used anywhere text is used. It's easy to change their color or apply effects like text shadows
via standard CSS properties.

There are two ways of using Blueprint UI icons, described in more detail in the
[**Icon component documentation**](#core/components/icon):
1. React component: `<Icon iconName="more" />`
2. CSS classes: `<span className="pt-icon-standard pt-icon-more />`

Many Blueprint [components](#core/components) provide an `iconName` prop, which supports both the
full name `pt-icon-projects` and the short name `projects`.
