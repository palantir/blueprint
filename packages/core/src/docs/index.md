@# Core

The __@blueprintjs/core__ NPM package is the basis of any Blueprint app. It includes many (30+)
React components covering all the basic bases, from buttons to form controls to tooltips and trees.
It also includes CSS styles for every component and the tools to style your own components and apps
with Sass and Less variables and an elegant color palette.

Make sure to review the [getting started docs for installation info](#blueprint/getting-started).

Note that the core package depends on __@blueprintjs/icons__ which provides 500+ UI icons.
You must include the icons CSS file in your app alongside the core CSS file.
