@# MultiSelect

MultiSelect renders a UI to choose multiple items from a list. It renders a
[TagInput](#core/components/tag-input) wrapped in a [Popover](#core/components/popover).
Just like with [Select](#select/select), you can pass in a predicate to customize the filtering algorithm.

The selection state of a MultiSelect is controlled with the `selectedItems` prop.
You may react to user interactions with the `onItemSelect` and `onRemove` callback props.

@reactExample MultiSelectExample

<div class="@ns-callout @ns-intent-primary @ns-icon-info-sign">
    <h5 class="@ns-heading">Generic components and custom filtering</h5>

For more information on controlled usage, generic components, creating new items, and custom filtering,
please visit the documentation for [Select](#select/select).
