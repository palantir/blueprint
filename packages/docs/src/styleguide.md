Blueprint is a React-based UI toolkit for the web.

Development and issue tracking occurs in [github.com/palantir/blueprint](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint).

Use the [__blueprintjs__ tag on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/blueprintjs)
for support requests.

Releases are tagged and documented [here on Github](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/releases)
(more info about releases [on the wiki](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint/wiki/Releases-&-Artifacts)).

## Usage

Blueprint is available as a collection of NPM packages under the `@blueprintjs` scope.

You'll need to install React `v15.x` or `v0.14.x` alongside Blueprint.

```sh
npm install --save @blueprintjs/core react react-dom react-addons-css-transition-group
```

Import components from the `@blueprintjs/core` module into your project.
Don't forget to include the main CSS stylesheet too!

**Review the [general usage docs](#components.usage) for more complete installation instructions.**

### Beyond core styles

Blueprint is a collection of packages of styles and JavaScript components&mdash;the full list appears in this
site's header under _Releases_. They can be installed from the NPM registry using commands similar to
those shown above. Once you've included any additional package(s) in your application, explore the
relevant sections in the sidebar for details about the styling & component APIs you have access to.

<div class="pt-callout pt-intent-primary pt-icon-info-sign">
  <h5>Don't forget the extra resources</h5>
  Most packages consist of JS and CSS resources, so please make sure you're including both in your application.
</div>

### TypeScript

Blueprint is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a statically typed superset
of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. All the code samples throughout this site and
all interactive examples are also written in TypeScript. TypeScript code looks exactly like ES2015+
code with the addition of type signatures.

```ts
// variables
const variableName: varType;
const name: string;
const disabled: boolean;

// functions (and function variables)
function funcName(arg1: argType, arg2: argType): returnType { }
const funcName: (arg1: argType) => returnType;
function split(str: string, delim: string): string[] { }
function map<T, U>(array: T[], iterator: (item: T, index: number) => U): U[];

// interfaces describe plain objects
// (we use the convention that interfaces begin with "I")
interface IOption {
  label: string;
  value: string;
}
const option: IOption = { label: "Name", value: "gilad" };
```

**You do not need to use TypeScript to consume Blueprint** (but major "props" if you do). Familiarity
with the syntax is suggested so you can follow our examples
([the handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) has good documentation
for getting started). Simply ignoring the type annotations in your head will produce valid ES2015 code.

### Browser support

**Blueprint supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE 11, and Microsoft Edge.**

You may experience degraded visuals in IE.
IE 10 and below are unsupported due to their lack of support for CSS Flexbox Layout.
These browsers were deprecated by Microsoft (end of support) in [January 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support).
