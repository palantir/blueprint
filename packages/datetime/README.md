# [Blueprint](http://blueprintjs.com/) Date & Time Components

Blueprint is a React UI toolkit for the web.

This package contains a collection of React components for working with dates and times.

Two third-party libraries are used in this package to ease the burden of time management:

- [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) is the de facto library for manipulating dates in JavaScript.
  We use it for formatting dates as strings.
- [react-day-picker](http://react-day-picker.js.org/) is a solid React calendaring library.
  We use it internally for the calendar and expose some parts of its API (particularly modifiers).

## Installation

```
npm install --save @blueprintjs/datetime
```
