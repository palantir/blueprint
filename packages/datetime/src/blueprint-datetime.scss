Date & time

<div class="pt-callout pt-intent-primary pt-icon-info-sign">
  <h5>Separate package required</h5>
  The date and time components do not ship with the `@blueprintjs/core` package,
  and must be installed separately as `@blueprintjs/datetime`.
</div>

This package provides several components for interacting with dates and times:

- [`DatePicker`](#components.datetime.datepicker) for selecting a single date (day, month, year).
- [`DateRangePicker`](#components.datetime.daterangepicker) for selecting date ranges.
- [`TimePicker`](#components.datetime.timepicker) for selecting a time (hour, minute, second, millisecond) selection.
- [`DateTimePicker`](#components.datetime.datetimepicker), which composes `DatePicker` and `TimePicker` to
select a date and time together.
- [`DateInput`](#components.datetime.dateinput), which composes a text input with a `DatePicker` in a
`Popover`, for use in forms.

They are available in the __@blueprintjs/datetime__ package on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/datetime).

Make sure to review the [general usage docs for JS components](#components.usage).

```sh
npm install --save @blueprintjs/datetime
```
