@# Date picker

DatePicker renders a UI to choose a single date and (optionally) a time of day.
It is built on top of the [__react-day-picker__ library](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker).
If a `timePrecision` is defined, it will show a [TimePicker](#datetime/timepicker) underneath the
calendar.

@## Usage

DatePicker supports both controlled and uncontrolled usage. You can control
the selected day by setting the `value` prop, or use the component in
uncontrolled mode and specify an initial day by setting `defaultValue`. Use the
`onChange` prop to listen for changes to the selected day.

@## Props interface

Some props are managed by the `DatePicker` component, while others are passed
to the __react-day-picker__ library. These passed-through props are documented in full
in the [__react-day-picker__ documentation](https://react-day-picker-v7.netlify.app/).

@interface IDatePickerProps

@## Shortcuts

The menu on the left of the calendars provides "shortcuts" which allow users to
quickly select common dates. The items in this menu are controlled through
the `shortcuts` prop:

- `false` (default) will hide the shortcuts menu,
- `true` will show the built-in shortcuts, and
- custom shortcuts can be shown by defining an array of `DatePickerShortcut` objects.

The **preset shortcuts** can be seen in the example above. They are as follows:

-   Today
-   Yesterday
-   1 week ago
-   1 month ago
-   3 months ago
-   1 year ago

**Custom shortcuts** use the following interface:

@interface IDatePickerShortcut

@## Modifiers

You can use the `modifiers` prop to conditionally apply styles to days.
Modifiers are a react-day-picker concept and are documented in full in the
[__react-day-picker__ documentation](https://react-day-picker-v7.netlify.app/docs/matching-days).

The example below renders a DatePicker that prevents the user from selecting any Sundays,
by using the component in controlled mode and with the `modifiers` prop:

```css.scss
// in CSS
.#{$ns}-datepicker .DayPicker-Day--isSunday {
    // CSS rules to make the day appear disabled
}
```

```tsx
// in TypeScript
import { DatePicker } from "@blueprintjs/datetime";

export class DatePickerExample extends React.Component<{}, { selectedDate: Date }> {
    public state = { selectedDate: new Date() };

    public render() {
        // name of modifier function becomes the suffix for the CSS class above
        const modifiers = { isSunday };
        return (
            <DatePicker
                modifiers={modifiers}
                onChange={newDate => this.handleChange(newDate)}
                value={this.state.selectedDate}
            />
        );
    }

    private handleChange(date: Date) {
        if (!isSunday(date)) {
            this.setState({ selectedDate: date });
        }
    }
}

function isSunday(date: Date) {
    return date.getDay() === 0;
}
```

@## Localization

`DatePicker`, `DateRangePicker`, `DateInput`, and `DateRangeInput` all support calendar localization
using an interface defined by __react-day-picker__:

```tsx
import { LocaleUtils } from "react-day-picker";
```

By supplying a `locale: string` and `localeUtils: LocaleUtils` prop to these Blueprint components,
you can customize how dates are rendered, which day of the week is the first column, etc.

You will need to define the functions of `LocaleUtil` on your own.
[See the interface definition](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/v7.3.0/types/utils.d.ts#L5)
for more details.

Although `@blueprintjs/datetime` and `react-day-picker` do not explicitly require
[__moment.js__](https://momentjs.com/) or [__date-fns__](https://date-fns.org/) as dependencies,
you may wish to use those third-party implementations of localization so that you do not have to
write these functions yourself.

To use moment.js for localization, make sure to include __moment__ in your dependencies and use
`MomentLocaleUtils` from `react-day-picker/moment` as follow:

```tsx
import MomentLocaleUtils from "react-day-picker/moment";
import "moment/locale/fr";

<DatePicker locale="fr" localeUtils={MomentLocaleUtils} />;
```

More detailed examples can be found in the
[__react-day-picker__ documentation](https://react-day-picker-v7.netlify.app/docs/localization).
