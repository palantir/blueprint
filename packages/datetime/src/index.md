@# Datetime

The [__@blueprintjs/datetime__ NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/datetime)
provides several components for interacting with dates and times:

- [`DatePicker`](#datetime/datepicker) for selecting a single date (day, month, year).

- [`DateRangePicker`](#datetime/daterangepicker) for selecting date ranges.

- [`TimePicker`](#datetime/timepicker) for selecting a time (hour, minute, second,
  millisecond).

- [`DateTimePicker`](#datetime/datetimepicker), which composes `DatePicker` and
  `TimePicker` to select a date and time together.

- [`DateInput`](#datetime/dateinput), which composes a text input with a `DatePicker` in
  a `Popover`, for use in forms.

- [`DateRangeInput`](#datetime/daterangeinput), which composes two text inputs with a `DateRangePicker` in
  a `Popover`, for use in forms.

Make sure to review the [getting started docs for installation info](#blueprint/getting-started).
